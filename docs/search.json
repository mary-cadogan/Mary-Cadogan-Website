    "text": "GIS Experience\nThis page includes a group final project I did for a GIS class that looked at Suitable Locations for Offshore Wind Farms on the East Coast\nSection 1: Project Summary\nOur project looked at potential suitable locations for offshore floating wind farms on the East Coast. As we are increasingly beginning to feel the impacts of anthropogenic climate change, the United States must seek to implement more sources of renewable energy. We still have a heavy reliance on the fossil fuel industry, despite it being a large climate change driver. Eventually its resources will run out and offshore wind farms provide a great source of reliable energy, if implemented strategically. Using ArcGIS to spatially analyze a bunch of different factors together is extremely crucial for determining suitable locations for wind farms. The factors we looked at were wind speed, bathymetry, shipping lanes, and Marine Protected Areas (MPAs). Our approach to finding the most efficient areas was to overlap all these datasets to see where offshore wind farms could exist. For example, they cannot exist in the middle of shipping lanes or MPAs. They must also have optimal wind speeds of greater than 7 m/s (\"Offshore Wind Technical Potential: Analysis and Maps\", 2022) and bathymetry of 50 to 200 m (Dvorek et al., 2010). If our country is going to invest into renewable energy implementation it is crucial that this research is done to optimize the amount of energy we can get out of the projects. We decided to look at the East Coast due to its shallower waters and lower tectonic activity. However, as we move forward we will also have to look at locations globally to meet demand.\nSection 2: Technical Report\nFor our project we used a variety of spatial analysis tools to determine suitable locations for floating offshore wind farms within 100 m off the East Coast. Below is a list of the data sets we used for the project:\n\n\n\nData content\nData file name\nData file format (shapefile, csv, geotiff, jpeg, img, geodatabase, etc.)\nData type (vector point, vector polygon, vector line, raster, data table)\nData source: name of provider (e.g. NASA, USGS, Census, etc) and a link to data website\n\n\nMPAs\nNOAA_MPAI_2020_IUCN_gdb.zip\nGeodatabase\nVector polygon\nNOAA\n\n\nShipping Lanes\nshippinglanes.zip\nShapefile\nVector line\nNOAA\n\n\nWind Speed\nNREL_HourlyWind_Atlantic_polysandpoints.zip\nGeodatabase\nVector point\nBOEM\n\n\nBathymetry\nGEBCO_2022 Grid\n(sub-ice topo/bathy)\nGeotiff\nRaster\nGEBCO\n\n\nUnited States Polygon\ns_22mr22.zip\nShapefile\nVector polygon\nWeather.gov\n\n\n\nAs the data table shows, almost all of the data sets were in a vector format so we had to convert the bathymetry raster data to vector during analysis. The attributes we used from this data are pretty self explanatory based on the data content. We used the United States Polygon layer so that we could select only the East Coast states. We looked at the physical locations of shipping lanes and MPAs to see where wind farms cannot be located. For wind speed and bathymetry, we ended up selecting certain values based on the attributes we needed. We needed areas with wind speeds greater than 7 m/s and depths of 50-200 m. These processes will be explained further in the next paragraph. \nThe analysis we did resulted in a final area of suitable locations for the offshore wind farms. In order to get from the raw data files to the final output, we had to do a lot of geoprocessing and conversions. We first added the United States polygon layer and then used the Select by Attribute tool to select only the states on the East Coast. We then dissolved the East Coast states into one singular polygon. Since we needed all of the layers to have a North America Lambert Conformal conic projection, we changed the projection for the map, shipping lanes, bathymetry, east coast polygon, and wind speed. We then added a buffer of 100 miles around the East Coast to account for feasible construction and implementation. When we tried to clip the other layers to fit the East Coast buffer, we encountered an error that required us to repair the geometry of the vector layers (all the layers minus bathymetry). After the layers were clipped to fit within the East Coast buffer, we used the Union tool to combine shipping lanes and MPAs to show all areas where wind turbines cannot be located. These were exported into one feature (shipping_lanes_mpas). We then used the Select by Attribute tool to select all areas where average wind speed is greater than 7 m/s. We then used the Raster Calculator tool to select the areas where bathymetry was between 50 m and 200 m and exported this as final_optimal_depth. We then converted this final_optimal_depth layer to vector using the Raster to Polygon tool. When we did this, we had to Select by Attribute (where gridcode is equal to 1) because this was the attribute with values of 50 m to 200 m. Once all layers were selected and in the same format, we used the Intersect tool to combine the optimal_wind and final_optimal_depth_polygon layers to create an optimal_conditions feature. Finally, we used the Erase tool to remove shipping_lanes_mpas from optimal_conditions to get the final area shown in the image. \nThe final results we got can be explained by the following image:\n\nThis image shows the final area where wind speeds were greater than 7 m/s, bathymetry was between 50 and 200 m, and there were no shipping lanes or MPAs present. Therefore, this is where offshore floating wind farms could be located. Looking at this image, it is important to note the location of large cities (such as New York City) and how close they are to potential wind farm areas. It is also important to consider that the East Coast has a large range of seasons, which may impact weather patterns such as wind storms. Further analysis would be required for this. The process we used to achieve this final result can be broken down into the following data layers:\n\nOne thing that I think could be added to improve the project is looking at the wind speeds on a greater scale. For example, a location may have an average wind speed of 10 m/s which is above the threshold established to be suitable for wind farms. However, this does not mean wind is consistent. It may be 1 m/s for a significant amount of days and have a few wind storms with very high wind speeds that would skew the average. This would not be suitable for offshore wind farms because we need consistent wind due to inefficient battery technology and wind turbines can also fail in extremely high winds. While this spatial analysis would be a lot more complicated, I think it would be important to look at. Also, to improve the project I think it would be important to include transmission line locations and human populations to track where the energy generated by the wind turbines would be going. It would be more efficient to locate them near larger cities or where transmission lines can handle the input of this new energy source. This would also require analysis on energy storage facilities for the wind turbines. Additionally, our optimal bathymetry depth was based just on requirements for floating wind turbines, not fixed. We also used wind speeds that were optimal for 100 m wind turbines and therefore optimal wind speeds may change as wind turbine height increases. \nThrough this project I learned how important spatial analysis is and that it is a great tool for solving our world's biggest challenges. As an Environmental Studies major, I have realized how crucial it is to understand how ArcGIS works. For example, it would be nearly impossible to try to envision suitable locations for projects like this without ArcGIS visually displaying the datasets. I also learned that I have a strong interest in this field, specifically renewable energy implementation. \nIf I had to do this project again I would add in more data sets, like transmission lines or do more in depth analysis of the criteria. Instead of just creating one area of \"suitable areas\" I would break it up by not-suitable, suitable, and then ideal. The ideal category would show the best areas, based on the most consistent, highest wind speeds located near populations of high energy demand with transmission lines already in place."

    "text": "Research Work\nNipomo Mesa Lupine Seed Predation and Herbivory Study\nAbstract\nThe 2022 Nipomo Mesa Lupine Seed Predation and Herbivory Study analyzed the impact that animals and insects have on the germination success of the Nipomo Mesa lupine. Seed and plant herbivory was monitored at two different sites in Nipomo, California to identify the species that have been predating on the lupine and also compare how different planting locations impact herbivory. The three different treatments monitored were seeds set out in caged plots, uncaged plots near vegetation, and uncaged plots far from vegetation. Seed count data was collected at the beginning of the monitoring process (January 24, 2022) and at the end (May 17th, 2022). This data indicated that caged plots had the most herbivory activity, and then uncaged near vegetation, and lastly uncaged far from vegetation. However, this data is not sufficient enough to draw conclusions because of the high likelihood that seeds were blown out of the bait boxes by wind. Motion sensor trail cameras were also set up at each one of the 8 plots and video footage was collected. Video footage indicated that uncaged sites near vegetation showed the most seed predation, with kangaroo rats and deer mice being the primary predators. Video footage from the  uncaged bait stations far from vegetation showed the most evidence of plant herbivory, mainly by cottontails and several bird species. Lastly, caged bait stations showed little herbivory activity, however birds and rodents were still seen in the cages. There was a high prevalence of insect activity in the caged plots but it is undetermined what their effect was. The camera\\’s capture rates were extremely low due to technical difficulties associated with the delay between the trigger and the start of the video and seed data was not collected frequently enough to rule out factors other than seed predation in the removal of seeds from the bait stations. Therefore, further studies should be conducted to analyze the impact of these species on the Nipomo Mesa Lupine due to the limitations of this study.\nIntroduction\nThe Nipomo Mesa lupine (Lupinus nipomensis) is listed as an endangered plant species under the  California Endangered Species Act, as well as federally endangered under the Endangered Species Act. With the introduction of invasive grasses (Ehrharta calycina) and loss of dune habitat from human development, the Nipomo Mesa Lupine population has significantly declined and its range is now limited to only 2 square miles within the Guadalupe-Nipomo Dunes complex. This area is one of the last coastal dune ecosystems in California and home to several unique species. Therefore, it is crucial to prevent the extinction of the Nipomo Mesa Lupine to maintain the natural ecological balance of the coastal dune ecosystem that the lupines are residing in. \nThe Seed Predation and Herbivory Study is a project of UCSB’s Cheadle Center for Biodiversity and Ecological Restoration Population Enhancement Project that seeks to re-establish the species population in the Black Lake Ecological Area and Kathleen Goddard Jones Overlook located in Nipomo, California. The Seed Predation Study seeks to answer why germination success in this area has been so low by monitoring the herbivory activity. With habitat loss, drought, invasive species, altered hydrology, and habitat fragmentation all limiting the growth of the Nipomo Mesa Lupine, it is important to understand the extent to which seed predation limits the growth of these plants. The knowledge gained through this study will help the Population Enhancement Project move forward by providing valuable information on overall seed predation interactions, comparisons across treatments for future seeding efforts, and ideas for further studies. \nMethods\nThis study was conducted using motion sensor cameras to track the differences in seed predation across three different seeding treatments. The three treatments being compared were placing seeds in caged plots with an open top, uncaged plots near shrub vegetation (UCNV), and uncaged plots far from shrub vegetation (UCFV). A total of 8 plots were observed: 4 caged plots, 2 uncaged plots near shrub vegetation (UCNV), and 2 uncaged plots farther (at least 5 feet) from vegetation (UCFV). In each plot, a seed box of 20 Nipomo Mesa lupine seeds were placed and covered in sand.\nAt each bait station a motion sensor camera was set up facing the seed box on January 24, 2022. Footage from each camera was collected and sorted through weekly or biweekly until May 17th, 2022. Each camera recorded videos in 20 second intervals, beginning at the moment of noticed activity. Data was collected on the varying species and their activities that were captured by the cameras. At the end of the study, seed bait stations were re-collected to see how many seeds remained and if there was any evidence of seed predation, via empty seed shells. Video footage was sorted, data was systematically entered, and then analyzed. \nResults\nSeed Box Count Data: Seed Box Data that was collected on January 24, 2022 (when the cameras were placed) was compared with the number of seeds still present on May 17th, 2022 (when the cameras were collected). “Full” seeds indicates seeds that are still fully intact and showed no signs of herbivory. “Half” seeds are cracked open seed shells that show evidence of some form of herbivory. “Hollow” seeds are shells that are still intact but have a hole with no seed present on the inside, perhaps an indication of insect herbivory. The data indicates that treatments with a higher number of seeds gone or showed signs of being eaten were more vulnerable to seed predation. The discussion section of this paper will present the limitations of these seed box count observations. However, using this data caged plots showed the highest signs of herbivory, and then uncaged near vegetation, and lastly uncaged far from vegetation (Figure 3). \n\nFigure 1: Summary of Seed Box Count Observations\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTreatment\nSeeds at 1/24/22\nSeeds at 5/17/22\n# Seeds Missing/Eaten\n% Seeds Gone\n\n\nCaged\n80\n13\n67\n83.75%\n\n\nUncaged  NV\n40\n12\n28\n70%\n\n\nUncaged FV\n40\n13\n27\n67.5%\n\n\n\nFigure 2: Breakdown of Seed Box Count Observations\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPlot\nTreatment\nSeeds at 1/24/22\nSeeds at 5/17/22\n\n\n9_B19_UC\nCaged\n20 full\n8 full, 3 half, 1 hollow\n\n\n2_B14_SC\nCaged\n20 full\n5 full, 2 half\n\n\n3_K_SC\nCaged\n20 full\n1 half\n\n\n2_K_UC\nCaged\n20 full\n1 hollow\n\n\n6_B14_SU\nUncaged NV\n20 full\n2 full, 3 half\n\n\n4_B19_SU\nUncaged NV\n20 full\n10 full, 3 half, 1 hollow\n\n\n7_B19_UU\nUncaged FV\n20 full\n5 full, 1 half\n\n\n1_B14_SU\nUncaged FV\n20 full\n8 full, 7 half, 1 hollow\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 3: Seed Box Count Grap\n[! [ ] (images/seedcountdata.png)]\nHerbivory data captured by motion sensor cameras:\nThere was no observed herbivory activity from the bobcats, skunks, lizards, badger, and deer. Overall, there was evidence of deer mice, kangaroo rats, goldfinches, and California towhees foraging in the seed boxes. There was clear evidence of cottontails foraging on maturing lupine plants but not on seeds. Ant and insect activity is marked as “unclear” because it was too difficult to determine their activity from the camera footage. Only ants and insects that were spotted in the seed box or near marked lupine plants were recorded in data. \n\n\nFigure 4: Breakdown of Species Observed Sorted by Treatment\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSpecies\n# IMG Caged\nTime (s)\n#IMG Uncaged NV\nTime (s)\n#IMG Uncaged FV\nTime (s)\n\n\nAnts\n159\n3,180\n15\n320\n88\n1,760\n\n\nBadger\n0\n0\n1\n20\n0\n0\n\n\nBobcat\n0\n0\n2\n30\n2\n40\n\n\nCalifornia quail\n0\n0\n3\n40\n1\n20\n\n\nCalifornia thrasher\n0\n0\n0\n0\n2\n40\n\n\nCalifornia towhee\n17\n340\n2\n40\n4\n80\n\n\nCottontails\n0\n0\n185\n2,820\n208\n2,431\n\n\nDeer\n0\n0\n13\n200\n0\n0\n\n\nDeer mice\n5\n100\n40\n760\n7\n122\n\n\nGoldfinch\n0\n0\n0\n0\n1\n20\n\n\nJackrabbits\n0\n0\n11\n200\n3\n60\n\n\nKangaroo rats\n6\n120\n22\n440\n4\n25\n\n\nLizards\n0\n0\n3\n40\n0\n0\n\n\nOther insects\n19\n380\n9\n170\n15\n300\n\n\nSkunk\n0\n0\n3\n40\n0\n0\n\n\nWhite-crowned sparrows\n1\n20\n3\n50\n39\n780\n\n\nUnidentifiable\n3\n60\n4\n30\n8\n143\n\n\nTotal\n210\n4,200\n315\n5,200\n382\n5,821\n\n\n\n\nFigure 5: Herbivory Activity at Uncaged, Near Vegetation Plots\n\n\nFigure 6: Herbivory Activity at Uncaged, Far From Vegetation Plots\n\n\n\nFigure 7: Herbivory Activity in Caged Plots\n\nCaged plots: There was the most observed activity from ants and other insects, however whether they were foraging or not on the seeds was unclear. California towhees, deer mice, kangaroo rats, and White-crowned sparrows were still getting into the cages and showing foraging activity. Camera footage indicates that animals were able to get into cages but that the cages did prevent a heavy amount of herbivory activity compared to uncaged plots. The results from the seed count data contradict the video data, because there was the least amount of foraging activity captured in the footage from the caged plots. \nUncaged near vegetation plots: The uncaged near vegetation plots had the most activity of foraging in the seed box. This primarily came from rodents, such as the deer mice and kangaroo rats. There was significantly less bird and insect activity in these plots. Cottontails were present but were mostly just passing through the area. These plots overall showed less activity than the uncaged far from vegetation plots but more than the caged plots. \nUncaged far from vegetation plots: The uncaged far from vegetation plots had very little foraging activity inside the seed bait boxes but a lot of activity outside the boxes. The only foraging inside the box came from a goldfinch. The foraging outside the boxes came primarily from cottontails and birds, such as the White-crowned sparrow, California thrasher, and California towhee. There was significantly less rodent activity compared to the uncaged near vegetation plots. There was more insect activity than the uncaged near vegetation plots, but still less than caged plots. Overall, uncaged far from vegetation had the highest amount of captured footage, but it was not directly associated with seed predation or herbivory on Nipomo mesa lupine (Figure 4). \nDiscussion:\nWhile this study did enhance knowledge about seed predation and herbivory of the Nipomo Mesa lupine, further studies will be required to fully comprehend the impact it has on seed germination success. The overall methodology of using motion sensor cameras for monitoring caused several limitations for the research process. There were various technical difficulties that caused the capture rate percentage of the cameras to be extremely low, as shown: \n Figure : Camera Footage Efficiency \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTreatment\nTotal operational time\nCapture time\n% Capture Rate\n\n\nUncaged NV\n3,120 hours\n1.44 hours\n0.0462 %\n\n\nUncaged FV\n3,120 hours\n1.62 hours\n0.0519 %\n\n\nCaged\n4,560 hours\n1.17 hours\n0.0257 %\n\n\nTotal\n10,800 hours\n4.323 hours\n0.0400 %\n\n\n\nOne technical difficulty included camera delays, where several footage shots showed animals leaving the boxes where foraging may have been present but could not be determined. Another was that the cameras would sometimes capture footage at intervals other than 20 seconds (10 seconds, 3, seconds, 1 second, etc.), which skewed the number of images. Additionally, there were a few times when the cameras did not work at all over the span they were placed. And lastly, SD cards filled up extremely quickly with wind footage so a lot of valuable footage of herbivory may have been missed. \nAll of these factors made data harder to compare and left a lot of unanswered questions. Therefore, further research should be conducted to better pinpoint what animals are having the biggest impact on seed germination, where these animals are located (ie. far from vegetation or not), and how to best prevent them from consuming the seeds and plants. Seed data should also be collected more frequently (a maximum of every few days) as wind may have had an impact on the seed data count. For example, it is unlikely that caged plots had the most herbivory based on the camera footage contradicting the seed count data (Figure 1). Additionally, when doing the seed count data material was visibly flying in and out of the boxes. Further studies may also look at the difference of native vs non-native vegetation and the impact of insect herbivory. For this study, all insect footage was too difficult to accurately determine if they were interacting with the seeds or not in the boxes. This is why insect activity is marked as unclear in the activity data. Field observation of insect herbivory may be beneficial as seeds that were hollowed out were found during the seed count. Lastly, sorting camera data was extremely time consuming for such a low capture rate. \n\nImages:\nImage 1: California towhee foraging on seeds (Caged)\n\nImage 2: Kangaroo Rat foraging on seeds (Uncaged NV)\n\n\nImage 3: Deer mouse foraging on seeds (Uncaged NV)\n\nImage 4: Cottontail foraging on lupine plant (Uncaged FV)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nImage 5: Goldfinch foraging on seeds (Uncaged FV)"
