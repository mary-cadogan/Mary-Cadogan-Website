# **Welcome to my page!**

My name is Mary Cadogan and I am from Westford, Massachusetts. I currently attend the University of California, Santa Barbara with a B.A. in Environmental Studies. My educational passions include ecological restoration, wildlife conservation, and renewable energy implementation. When I am not doing school, I love spending my time outdoors with friends going hiking, backpacking, and snowboarding!
